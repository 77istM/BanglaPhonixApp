Welcome to the Bengali Alphabet Learning App! This guide will help you get started with learning Bengali characters through interactive drawing practice.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Install the app on your Android device
2. Launch the app from your app drawer
3. You'll see a splash screen followed by the topic selection screen

### Selecting a Topic

From the topic selection screen, you can choose which type of Bengali characters you want to practice:

- **Vowels (স্বরবর্ণ)**: The basic vowel sounds in Bengali
- **Consonants (ব্যঞ্জনবর্ণ)**: The consonant characters
- **Numbers (সংখ্যা)**: Bengali numerical digits
- **Compound Letters (যুক্তাক্ষর)**: Combined character forms

Each topic card shows your progress in that category. Tap on a card to begin practicing that category.

## Practice Screen

The practice screen is where you'll learn to write Bengali characters:

### Screen Elements

- **Top**: The current character's romanized name
- **Middle**: The drawing area where you practice writing
- **Bottom**: Navigation and control buttons

### Drawing Practice

1. Look at the character displayed in the drawing area
2. Follow the guidance dots to draw the character with your finger
3. Start at the indicated starting point and follow the stroke direction
4. Complete each stroke one by one

### Guidance System

If you're having trouble, you can use different levels of guidance:

- Tap the **Show Hint** button to cycle through guidance levels:
  - **Dots Only**: Shows start and end points for each stroke
  - **Show Arrows**: Adds directional arrows to guide your stroke direction
  - **Show Full Path**: Shows the complete path with animation

The guidance level will automatically increase if you make multiple unsuccessful attempts.

## Feedback System

The app provides several types of feedback to help you learn:

### Visual Feedback

- **Blue**: Guidance elements

### Audio Feedback

- Success sounds when you complete a stroke correctly
- Error sounds when a stroke is drawn incorrectly
- Completion sound when you finish a character

### Haptic Feedback

## Progress Tracking

Your progress is automatically saved as you practice:

- Completed characters are marked in your progress
- Each category shows a progress bar on the topic selection screen
- The app remembers where you left off in each category

## Tips for Effective Learning

1. **Start with vowels**: They're generally simpler than consonants
2. **Practice regularly**: Short, frequent sessions are better than long, infrequent ones
3. **Follow the stroke order**: Bengali characters have specific stroke orders that are important to learn
4. **Use the guidance system**: Start with full guidance and gradually reduce it as you improve
5. **Listen to pronunciations**: Understanding the sound helps associate it with the written form

## Troubleshooting

- If the app doesn't respond to your touch, try restarting it
- If you're having trouble with a specific character, use the "Show Full Path" guidance
- Make sure your screen is clean and your fingers are dry for best touch response
